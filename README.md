Part of speech (POS) tagging is a system of annotating every word in a text with its part of speech. It is a significant pre-processing step in many Natural Language
Processing (NLP) applications. There are 5.2 million people who speak Mongolian all over the world. We developed two POS taggers for Mongolian, namely Neural Networks - Multilayer Perceptron and Hidden Markov
Model with Viterbi.
